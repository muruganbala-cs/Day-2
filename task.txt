Window Objects
==>The Window object is a global object in client-side JavaScript, representing the browser window containing a DOM document and acting as the root of the document object model.
==>It is the root level element in any web page.
==>All the global variables are defined on the window object.
==>For example, alert(), confirm() are methods defined on the window object.
==>Writing alert() is similar to a window.alert()
==>Also, properties like document and location are properties of the window object.

==>You can access it via a window. document or document.
==>document object has many useful methods defined on it.
==>For example, document.getElementById(), document.getElementByTagName(), document.createElement(), document.querySelector() and many more
